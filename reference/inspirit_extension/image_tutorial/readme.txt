(This runs on windows, dunno how macs work)
1. Go to the darknet-master folder
2. Find "darknet_webcam-tiny-custom.bat"
3. Edit the cd command location from "C:\Users\offshore account\darknet-master\" to the location of the darknet file folder
4. You should then be able to run the .bat file, and it will pull up the object detector if a camera is attached. 

(You'll see the inaccuracy as it will probably detect you as me...)
